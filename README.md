# tackyboard
A job search assistant board.


# Installation:
To install, clone the repo and you should have two folders, `tackyboard-frontend` and `tackyboard-backend`.

We'll start with the backend first.
Go into `tackyboard-backend` and we'll start off by making a python virtual environment.
1. Run `python3 -m venv venv`. This makes the virtual enviornment (venv).
2. Then run `source venv/bin/activate`. This should activate the venv.
3. Now we need to install all the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Once the previous steps are complete, run `flask run` to start the backend.

Now for the frontend.
Go into `tackyboard-frontend` and run `npm install` and then when that's done and has no problems, run `npm start` while the backend is running
